    "**Formal Definition**: K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions a dataset $X={x_1,x_2,...,x_n}$ into $K$ disjoint clusters $C={c_1,c_2,...,c_k}$, where each clusters is represented by its centroid (mean) $\\mu_{k}$, with the objective of minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares.\n",

    "Kmeans is build around a very simple idea ; Represent a group of points by a single representative point ; what does central even mean . The answers depends on the distance we use. Under Euclidean distance squared, something magical happens; The point that minimize the total squared distance to all points is the mean. This is not true for most other distances.\n",
