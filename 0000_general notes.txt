# 1. Sorting & Related Topics
# - Built-in sort / sorted
# - Custom sort with key / lambda
# - Counting sort / bucket sort / radix sort (basics)
# - Rotations & circular arrays (rotated sorted array search)
# - Finding kth largest / smallest element

# 2. Number Sequences & Math
# - Factorial, combinations, permutations
# - Fibonacci sequence (recursive, iterative, DP)
# - Prime numbers, GCD / LCM
# - Sum of digits, number reversal, palindrome numbers
# - Modular arithmetic (common in probabilities or hashing)

# 3. Searching
# - Linear search
# - Binary search (on sorted arrays)
# - Search for first/last occurrence
# - Search in rotated sorted arrays
# - Search using two pointers or sliding window

# 4. Hashing & Maps
# - Counting occurrences using dict / Counter
# - Finding duplicates, missing numbers
# - Two sum / pair sum problems
# - Sliding window with hash map for strings or arrays

# 5. Two Pointer Technique
# - Pair sum problems
# - Triplets with given sum
# - Partitioning arrays
# - Moving start & end pointers based on conditions

# 6. Sliding Window
# - Maximum / minimum in window
# - Sum or average of subarrays of size k
# - Longest substring with unique characters
# - Variable size window for problems like “smallest subarray with sum >= target”

# 7. Single Pointer / Simple Iteration Patterns
# - Prefix sum arrays
# - Counting problems with one pass
# - Accumulation / cumulative product
# - Array modification in-place

# 8. Basic Dynamic Programming (Easy / Medium)
# - Fibonacci sequence (iterative DP)
# - Coin change (basic)
# - Climbing stairs / number of ways
# - Maximum subarray sum (Kadane’s algorithm)
# - Simple memoization patterns

# 9. String Patterns / Sequences
# - Palindromes (check & longest)
# - Reverse words in string
# - Substrings with given properties
# - Basic compression / run-length encoding

# 10. Miscellaneous Array Tricks
# - Prefix sum & difference array
# - Product of array except self
# - Subarray problems: sum, max/min, length
# - Rotation and reversal tricks
# - In-place swapping / partitioning

# 11. Bit Manipulation Basics
# - XOR for single element / duplicates
# - Checking odd/even, set/unset bits
# - Counting bits (popcount)
# - Simple masking problems
