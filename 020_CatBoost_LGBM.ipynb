    "**LightGBM** is optimized for speed and large-scale datasets by changing how trees are built and how splits are evaluated, while CatBoost focuses on handling categorical features correctly and reducing training bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LightGBM uses **histogram-based splits**, where continuous features are bucketed into bins, making split finding faster and more memory efficient\n",
    "- LightGBM grows trees **leaf-wise instead of level-wise**, always splitting the leaf with the highest loss reduction, which leads to faster convergence but requires strong regularization to avoid overfitting\n",
    "- LightGBM handles **missing values natively** by learning the optimal direction for missing data during training\n",
    "\n",
    "**CatBoost** is designed to work well with categorical data and small-to-medium datasets by reducing target leakage and prediction bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CatBoost handles **categorical features natively** without requiring one-hot or manual target encoding\n",
    "- It uses **ordered target statistics**, computing category encodings using only past data to avoid target leakage\n",
    "- CatBoost applies **ordered boosting**, which reduces prediction shift by computing gradients in an unbiased way\n",
    "- It builds **symmetric (oblivious) trees**, using the same split at each depth, improving regularization and inference speed\n",
    "- LightGBM is preferred for very large datasets and high-dimensional data where training speed is critical\n",
    "- CatBoost is preferred when datasets contain many categorical features and when minimal preprocessing is desired"
