    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A UK-based credit card issuer is experiencing **high customer churn within the first 12 months** of card issuance.\n",

    "**Business Objective:**\n",
    "- Reduce early-life churn (0–12 months)\n",
    "- Improve customer engagement and lifetime value (CLV)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Success Metrics:**\n",
    "- 12-month churn rate\n",
    "- Activation rate (first transaction within X days)\n",
    "- Monthly active usage\n",
    "- Average spend per customer\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Initial Churn Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to **quantify and understand churn**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Problem Framing\n",
    "\n",

    "- Is the decline in **revenue, units sold, or both**?\n",
    "- Is the decline **company-wide or limited to specific products, regions, or channels**?\n",
    "- What is the **time frame** and baseline for comparison (MoM, YoY)?\n",
