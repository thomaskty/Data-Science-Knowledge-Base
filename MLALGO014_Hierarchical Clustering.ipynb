    "- Two main types:\n",
    "    1. **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up)** – start with each point as its own cluster, merge iteratively\n",
    "    2. **Divisive (Top-Down)** – start with all points in one cluster, split iteratively\n",

    "- **Distance Metric**: measure of dissimilarity between points : Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine, etc.\n",
    "- **Linkage Criteria**: measure of distance between clusters\n",
    "    - **Single Linkage**: distance between closest points of clusters\n",
    "    - **Complete Linkage**: distance between farthest points\n",
    "    - **Average Linkage**: average distance between points in clusters\n",

    "- **Compute Distances**: Calculate distances between all clusters.\n",
    "- **Merge**: Find the two closest clusters and merge them.\n",
    "- **Update Distances**: Recompute distances between the new cluster and all other clusters (based on chosen linkage).\n",
    "- **Repeat**: Until all points are in **one cluster** or until **stopping criterion** (e.g., desired number of clusters or distance threshold) is reached\n",

    "- Instead of just looking at distance between points, it **looks at the increase in total within-cluster variance** if two clusters are merged.\n",
    "- At each step, it merges the **pair of clusters that causes the smallest increase in total variance**."
