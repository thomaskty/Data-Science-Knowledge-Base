    "\n",
    "- Bagging focuses on variance reduction\n",
    "- Multiple models are trained independently\n",
    "- Each model sees a different bootstrap sample ( sampling with replacement)\n",
    "- Predictions are combined by averaging or majority vote.\n",
    "- Works best for high variance models ( decision trees)\n",

    "## Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focuses on bias reduction\n",
    "- Models are trained sequentially\n",
    "- Each new model focuses on previous mistakes\n",
    "- Predictions are combined using weighted sums\n",

    "## Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combines different types of models\n",
    "- Multiple diverse base models are trained in parallel\n",
    "- Their predictions are used as features for a meta-model\n",
    "- The meta model learns how to weight or combine base predictions.\n",
    "- logistic regression on top of RF + SVM + GBM\n",

    "Voting combines multiple models using simple aggregation rules\n",

    "- High bias, underfitting → **Boosting**\n",
    "- Very different model types → **Stacking**\n",
    "- Simple ensemble baseline → **Voting**\n",
    "- Categorical-heavy data → **CatBoost**\n",
    "- Massive dataset, speed matters → **LightGBM**"
